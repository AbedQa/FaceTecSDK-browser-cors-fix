# üîê GitHub Authentication Fix

Your repository was created successfully at:
**https://github.com/AbedQa/FaceTecSDK-browser-cors-fix**

But there's an authentication issue preventing the push. Here are the solutions:

## Option 1: Use Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Create a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "FaceTec Project"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

2. **Use the token to push:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/AbedQa/FaceTecSDK-browser-cors-fix.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token you copied.

## Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (If you have it)

```bash
gh auth login
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Use SSH (If you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:AbedQa/FaceTecSDK-browser-cors-fix.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 4: Manual Upload

If the above doesn't work, you can manually upload:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/AbedQa/FaceTecSDK-browser-cors-fix
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop your project folder
4. Commit the files

## Quick Test

After authentication is fixed, run:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Your Repository URL
https://github.com/AbedQa/FaceTecSDK-browser-cors-fix

The repository is created and ready - just need to authenticate the push!
